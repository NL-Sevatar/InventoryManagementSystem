# InventoryManagementSystem

10/9/2023 
This is the begining of a new project centered around the creation of a Inventory Management System. Utilizing a database we will be able to query, update, add, and delete various items within the system. We will have a tracking system set up so you can find which location the item is located along with quantity. I will also be including a auth system for logging into the system for access control along with roles w/ different levels of permissions.

Core Features

* Login/Auth System 
* User roles and permissions
* Intergration with DB for management of items.
* Auto-reordering of products when a threshold is met that is not static amongst all products.
* Location system with Max weight limits and safeguards to prevent exceeding max weight for each rack.
* Using a API to pull a shipping cost calculator.

Down the road I may turn this into a web app and build a front-end as well.
